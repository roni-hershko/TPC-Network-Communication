# **<u>TFTP SERVER CLIENT By Roni Hershko</u>**

## About the Project
This project involves the implementation of an extended TFTP (Trivial File Transfer Protocol) server and client in Java, designed to facilitate file transfer operations. The purpose of this project is to develop a system where multiple users can upload, download, and manage files on a server, with real-time notifications when files are added or deleted. The server follows the Thread-Per-Client (TPC) pattern and supports bi-directional message passing, enabling robust client-server communication. 
This project demonstrates my skills in network programming, concurrency, protocol implementation, and the use of Java, Maven, and binary data handling.
